## Form Input 

### 90&deg;
**Required**
- Length of stub
- Size of pipe
- Type of pipe

### Offset
**Required**
- Depth of Offset
- Length to obstruction
- Suggested Angle
- Override suggested angle
**Instructions**
- Offset depth multiplied by shrink/inch for chosen angle, equals shrink distance
- add the calculated shrink distance to the distance to obstruction, equals first mark.
- take offset distance and multiply by the multiplier for chosen angle to find the second mark. This is measured back to the start of the pipe. 
- The first mark is the further mark and the second is where the offset will start.
- Use arrow marks for both. Can really use any mark just has to be the same each mark.

### 3-Point Saddle 
- Find distance to center of obstruction.
- Calculate shrink based off the center bends corresponding shrink amount that was chosen multiplied by the height of the obstruction.
- Find the distance of center marks based off the obstruction height.
